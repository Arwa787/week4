#  Horse Breed Classification Using CNN

##  Overview
This project classifies horse breeds from images using deep learning.  
It uses both a **custom CNN** and **transfer learning with ResNet18** to achieve accurate predictions.

The dataset contains images labeled by their file prefixes corresponding to these horse breeds:

- **Akhal-Teke**  
- **Appaloosa**  
- **Orlov Trotter**  
- **Vladimir Heavy Draft**  
- **Percheron**  
- **Arabian**  
- **Friesian**
